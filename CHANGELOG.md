# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `fixthis_claim_feedback` MCP tool — agents call it before starting work on an item; status moves to `in_progress` and the browser console reflects the change within ~2 seconds.
- ETag-based polling on `/api/sessions` and `/api/session` (304 when unchanged); the console polls every 2 seconds and refreshes status badges live.
- `inProgressItemsCount` in session summaries, surfaced as a `working` pip on each History row.
- `agent_protocol:` footer plus per-item `id:` token in the compact handoff prompt so the Copy Prompt route is self-describing.
- `includeAll` parameter on `fixthis_list_feedback` and `fixthis_read_feedback`.

### Changed

- `fixthis_list_feedback` and `fixthis_read_feedback` now default to returning only `delivery: sent` items that are not resolved. Pass `includeAll: true` to restore the previous behavior.
- `fixthis_resolve_feedback` description now mentions the claim/resolve pairing.
- "Save to MCP" toast now reads `Saved to MCP ✓ — agent will pick up`.

### Removed

- Sent History drawer in the browser console. Sessions stay in the main History list; the per-row `×` button still closes a session.
- `points` pip on History rows (replaced by `working`).

### Fixed

- Canvas `blocked-reason` overlay now renders even before the first screenshot arrives, so screen-off / locked / backgrounded states are communicated during initial connection instead of staying invisible until the first preview lands.
- Connection-status changes now re-render the preview region, so the canvas overlay and input gating refresh immediately when blocked-reason transitions occur (previously the overlay could lag behind the chip until the next preview frame).
- Removed a disruptive browser alert dialog that interrupted the workflow when copying the prompt; copying now works silently without a popup.
- "Copy Prompt" and "Send Agent" buttons are now correctly disabled while a request is in progress, preventing duplicate submissions.
- Switching focus between annotation entries no longer discards in-progress comment text; any pending comment is saved before the focus change takes effect.
- Annotation comment text entered in an input field is now persisted when the field loses focus, so drafts are no longer silently dropped.
- Status bar correctly clears a previous success indicator when a new error message is shown.
- Repeated heartbeat/bridge connectivity errors are now suppressed in the status bar; only the first occurrence of an identical error is shown until the next successful heartbeat resets the dedup state, eliminating noisy repeated alerts when the bridge is offline.
- Removed a duplicate static `#selectionOverlay` element from the preview region; the overlay is now created and managed exclusively by the JS preview frame, preventing rare double-overlay rendering and stale DOM state.
- Empty preview stage now shows context-appropriate guidance instead of a single generic message: "Connect a device to get started." when no session is active, "Waiting for first capture from device…" when connected without a screenshot yet, and "No screenshot artifact for this preview." when a screen exists but its image is missing.

- Fixed annotation screen mismatch in the feedback console: after saving annotations on one screen and navigating the device to another, the preview now shows the live device screen instead of staying stuck on the previous screenshot. Clicking a saved annotation swaps the preview to that annotation's saved screenshot and shows only that screen's annotation pins; deselecting returns to the live preview. Cross-screen pin overlap (screen 1 pins appearing on a screen 2 preview) is also eliminated.
- `fixthis setup --write` now includes the underlying parse/validation error in the merge-failure message instead of swallowing it.
- `fixthis setup --write` now produces an actionable error when an existing `.claude/settings.json` has `mcpServers` set to a non-object value (e.g., array or string), instead of leaking a cryptic `JsonElement is not a JsonObject` message.
- The "`fixthis-mcp` executable not found" warning during `fixthis setup --write` now explains the consequence (MCP clients will fail to start FixThis) and the fix command (`./gradlew :fixthis-mcp:installDist`).

### Changed

- `fixthis setup --write` output now labels each written config with its scope: `(project-local)` for Claude (project's `.claude/settings.json`) and `(global)` for Codex (user's `~/.codex/config.toml`). Affects both the success line and the `--dry-run` `Target:` line.

### Added

- Console now models a `Connected` sub-state for screen-off, app-backgrounded, lock screen, Picture-in-Picture, unresponsive sample app, and "no Compose UI on this screen", with a canvas overlay, canvas-input gating, top-bar chip suffix, and automatic resume of the prior tool mode, frozen preview, and pending pins when the cause clears. Sidekick exposes `screenInteractive`, `keyguardLocked`, `appForeground`, and `pictureInPicture` on `BridgeStatus`.
- "Copy Prompt" button now briefly displays a "Copied ✓" confirmation after copying to the clipboard, giving clear visual feedback.
- "Send Agent" action now shows a success status message in the console status bar after the request completes successfully.
- Severity and status segmented buttons in both pending and saved annotation panels now expose `aria-pressed` state, so screen readers correctly announce which option is currently selected.
- Keyboard-only users now see a clear focus ring (2px accent-color outline) on tool, zoom, annotation back, and segmented buttons; the ring uses `:focus-visible` so it does not appear on mouse clicks.

- Added: `fixthis_status` now reports `installStale` plus an `installStaleHint` when host source files are newer than the installed APK; each `SourceCandidate` carries `stale`/`staleReason` so AI agents can detect coordinates that no longer match host source.
- SourceMatcher confidence is now margin- and evidence-aware. HIGH is reserved for strong evidence with a clear top-vs-next margin. Visual-area, text-only, nearby-only, activity-only, arbitrary-literal, and legacy-fallback matches carry explicit risk caps and caution text.
- SourceCandidate gains optional ranking, scoreMargin, evidenceStrength, riskFlags, and caution metadata. Older persisted sessions remain compatible.
- The console "Copy Prompt" / "Send Agent" output and DetailMode.COMPACT Markdown switch to a compact `src? file:line confidence; why=tokens; risk=token` shape with a single top-level verification rule and screen-level screenshot context. PRECISE/FULL output is unchanged.
- Same-screen annotation targets that overlap (visual-area intersection, IoSA >= 0.25, or weak-label center distance <= 24dp at default density) are split into explicit overlap groups in compact handoff.
- Added project stabilization planning and documentation for the console contract, CI, onboarding, MCP maintainability, evidence quality, local security, and release readiness.
- Added CI-oriented verification scripts, contributor guidance, zero-setup MCP configuration helpers, and connected smoke diagnostics for local development.
- Improved MCP feedback console maintainability through route, session service, and JavaScript module splits while preserving existing MCP tool and console behavior.
- Added Stable Target Evidence/source-index signals and sample coverage fixtures for repeatable evidence quality checks.
- Hardened local console mutation endpoints with browser token and origin checks, and added cleanup support for known local `.fixthis` artifacts.
- Documented current release blockers, including the missing root `LICENSE` and unpublished external artifact coordinates.
- Added AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md at repo root and a "Use with Claude Code or Codex" section in README so Claude Code and Codex users can discover the existing fixthis setup --write workflow without digging through source. Added an English translation of docs/project-overview.md as docs/project-overview.en.md.

### Changed

- Compact feedback handoff prompt v2 — replaced single-line `src?` hint with a multi-candidate `candidates:` block, added `viewport:`, `activity:`, `instance i/N`, collision and duplicate-marker notes; matcher now populates `scoreMargin`. PRECISE/FULL detail modes and JSON wire format unchanged.
- Sessions polling now silently absorbs up to 5 consecutive failures, then pauses and surfaces a "Reconnecting feedback updates…" sub-line on the connection card. Polling resumes automatically when the tab becomes visible again or the user takes any successful mutating action.
- Bulk status changes (≥6 items in a single polling tick) skip the per-item highlight effect to avoid visual noise; single-item updates highlight as before.

### Docs

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-10-mcp-handoff-workflow-completion.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-mcp-handoff-workflow-completion-design.md` amended in-place with correction notes for T21 (`delivery !== 'sent'` filter removal) — the original 3-site instruction targeted code that had already been refactored; only `preview.js:75` was actually modified at execution time.
